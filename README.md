# Tutorial on Infrastructure-as-Code

This repository is a collection of examples and explanations of the concept of
infrastructure-as-code and of the tools used to implement that concept. The
[Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_Code) is a
great place to start.

This repository is currently a work in progress. This is as much an exercise
in self-education as anything else.

Use the instructions in SANDBOX.md to create a Virtualbox VM instance where
you can play with this stuff without trashing your normal working environment.

This isn't my first time trying to understand this stuff:
[one earlier time](https://github.com/wware/grok-vagrant-ansible),
[another earlier time](https://github.com/wware/eb-flaskapp). I'll need to pick
through these to see what I can find that's useful.
