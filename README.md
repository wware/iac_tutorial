# Tutorial on Infrastructure-as-Code

This repository is a collection of examples and explanations of the concept of
infrastructure-as-code and of the tools used to implement that concept. The
[Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_Code) is a
great place to start.

This repository is also intended to accompany the
[Wikibook on this topic](https://simple.wikibooks.org/wiki/Getting_Started_with_Infrastructure_as_Code)
that I am putting together. For a while, both the repository and the wikibook are
going to be a work in progress. This is as much an exercise in self-education as
anything else.
